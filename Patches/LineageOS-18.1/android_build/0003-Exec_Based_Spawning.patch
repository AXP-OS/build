Subject: [PATCH] disable enforce RRO for mainline devices

RROs are currently incompatible with exec-based spawning. This also
impacts the wrapper spawning model for the stock OS which is available
by default, making it an upstream bug rather than a missing feature for
exec-based spawning in GrapheneOS.
