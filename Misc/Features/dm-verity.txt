dm-verity has been supported since KitKat! Why isn't it enabled on all devices???

fstab /system
	verify=[metadata partition]

device.mk
	ifeq ($(TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT),user)
	PRODUCT_SYSTEM_VERITY_PARTITION := [system partition]
	$(call inherit-product, build/target/product/verity.mk)
	endif

init.device.rc
	on init
		# Load persistent dm-verity state
		verity_load_state
	on early-boot
		# Update dm-verity state and set partition.*.verified properties
		verity_update_state
