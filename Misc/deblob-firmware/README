This is a simple flashable zip used to remove firmware from the /firmware and /vendor partitions.
This is necessary in order to remove untrusted proprietary code and to increase security.
See https://bits-please.blogspot.com/2016/05/qsee-privilege-escalation-vulnerability.html for an exploit (CVE-2015-6639) that uses the Widevine firmware.
